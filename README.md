# Pig_Game_JS Tutorial Project 

## Deploy: pig-game-brataus.netlify.app

### Rules:
Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":

1. If the player rolls a 1, his current score becomes 0 and it becomes the next player's turn.
2. If the player rolls any other number, it is added to his score total and the player's turn continues.
3. If a player chooses to "hold", his current score is added to his total score, and it becomes the next player's turn.

The first player to score 100 or more points wins.
